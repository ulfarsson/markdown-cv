## Personal

Born 11/21/1981 in Reykjavik, Iceland. Citizen of Iceland. Married with three daughters


### Research interests

My main research area is in the intersection of combinatorics and the theory of
algorithms. I focus on permutation patterns and algorithms to prove and
conjecture results about them. I have also worked in algebraic geometry, mostly
on Schubert varieties, and in ad-hoc wireless networks, especially on the
SINR-model.
